# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

:80 {
        reverse_proxy /cosmos_notifier_grpc* envoy:8090

        # Set this path to your site's directory.
        root * /var/www/cosmos-notifier-sycamore
        encode gzip

        try_files {path} /

        # Enable the static file server.
        file_server
}
